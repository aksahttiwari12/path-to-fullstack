# path-to-fullstack
ðŸš€A personal documentation of my journey into Full Stack Development â€” from basics to advanced projects. This repo contains notes, code snippets, and projects I build while learning frontend, backend, databases, and deployment. The goal is to track my progress, share my learnings, and showcase my growth as a developer.
