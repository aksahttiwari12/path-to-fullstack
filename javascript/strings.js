//STRINGS
//In JavaScript, you can choose single quotes ('), double quotes ("), or backticks (`) to wrap your strings in.
 const name = "Chris";
 const greeting = `Hello, ${name}`;
 console.log(greeting); // "Hello, Chris"
 const joined = `${greeting} ${string}`;
 console.log(joined);
let text="HELLO WORLD";
 console.log(text.charAt(4));
let letter=text.at(2);
console.log(letter);
//Strings are immutable: Strings cannot be changed, only replaced.
//All string methods return a new string. They don't modify the original string
console.log(text.slice(2,4));
console.log(text.slice(-5,-1));
console.log(text.slice(2));
//In JavaScript, null is not a “reference to a non-existing object” or a “null pointer” like in some other languages.
//It’s just a special value which represents “nothing”, “empty” or “value unknown”.
//The meaning of undefined is “value is not assigned”.
